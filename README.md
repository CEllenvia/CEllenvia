## Projects

In IaSoC Network Connections Dept, I am working on [DireconNET project](https://github.com/direconNET) , which is intended to build Wireless Routers which suitable for conditions of remote working in IaSoC.

I also works on mainlining [Mi Pad 7.9(xiaomi-mocha)](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Mi_Pad_(xiaomi-mocha)), the tablet released in 2014. 

In the spare time, I write some articles under [the worldview of *Ellenvia*](https://github.com/iasoc/ellenvia). 

## Workflow

I use Arch Linux as my main OS. For the compute instance, I use Ubuntu, Debian and Alpine, depending on the environmment and requirement.
